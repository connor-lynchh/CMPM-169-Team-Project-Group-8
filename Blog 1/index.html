                    <p class="mb-4">As a member of the crew aboard the S.S. Eternity, my days were filled with
                        routine tasks and duties, from ensuring the comfort and safety of our passengers to maintaining
                        the condition of the ship. I loved my job until I started noticing peculiar things happening
                        on the ship.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">At first, it was nothing more than a faint whisper echoing through the empty
                        corridors or a swift shadow darting out of sight. I dismissed these occurrences as the product
                        of my own imagination, I figured I was hallucinating from being tired and being out at sea for
                        such long hours.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">But as the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the sightings became
                        impossible to ignore. I would catch glimpses of ghostly figures roaming the decks, their
                        ethereal forms shimmering in the dim moonlight. They seemed to move with purpose, yet their
                        faces remained obscured to me, and I still have no idea what their intentions are.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The worst part about this whole thing is that I think I'm the only one on board
                        who can see these beings. I'm thankful that they haven't done anything other than roam the
                        halls. But at our next destination, I'm getting off this ship and resigning from my
                        position.</p>

                <p> After several eerie encounters aboard the S.S. Eternity, I decided to investigate further. 
                    To my shock, I discovered that the strange occurrences were caused by a malfunctioning security system, creating ghostly illusions throughout the ship.
                     Rest assured, there are no actual supernatural entities haunting the ship.
                    Please enjoy my stories, and remember, reality can be stranger than fiction.
