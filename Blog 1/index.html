                    <p>As a member of the crew aboard the S.S. Eternity, my days were filled with routine tasks and duties, from ensuring the comfort and safety of our passengers to maintaining the condition of the ship. I loved my job until I started noticing peculiar things happening on the ship.</p>
                    <p>At first, it was nothing more than a faint whisper echoing through the empty corridors or a swift shadow darting out of sight. I dismissed these occurrences as the product of my own imagination, I figured I was hallucinating from being tired and being out at sea for such long hours.</p>
                    <p>But as the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, the sightings became impossible to ignore. I would catch glimpses of ghostly figures roaming the decks, their ethereal forms shimmering in the dim moonlight. They seemed to move with purpose, yet their faces remained obscured to me, and I still have no idea what their intentions are.</p>
                    <p>The worst part about this whole thing is that I think I'm the only one on board who can see these beings. I'm thankful that they haven't done anything other than roam the halls. But at our next destination, I'm getting off this ship and resigning from my position.</p>
