# BRENDAN's PROJECT IDEA
Brendan's idea of how this will look
1. start at Homepage (describes company, job, or whatever)
3. Homepage can go to blog A, blog B, blog V
4. blog A/B/C can go to Homepage
maybe play around with simple javascript so you can check off a blog to say that it was read
when a blog is flagged it CAN cause a blog to change if it uses the javascript file from blog 3 as an example. Just needs to change it to review# with # being your blog number
