				<h2 style="color: black;">About the writer</h2>
				<p style="color: black;">I live in North Maryland. I have 2 dogs. One is named Maya and the other is named CoCo. I like gardening and taking walks in the park with my dogs.
				   My favorite food is burgers and fries. I also love watching TV and kid show animations. My favorite show is Animal House.

			<div class="story">
				<p >It was summer time and the weather was hot. I went to my friend's house to see their new dog. It was a little baby chihuahua. It was barking and running around a lot.
					I got to pet it and walk it and feed it treats. Its name was Hannah. Then after seeing the dog me and my friend walked to Watkins park and I saw a family walking next to us.
					They were an old man and a young woman. They walked to there house quickly and closed the door. I thought it was scary because the mans face was dirty and his teeth were not clean.
				</p>
				<p>I went home and went to sleep. The next day I went back to my friends house and when we walked to the park I saw the family again. The old man didnt look scary any more.
					His teeth was clean and his face was clean. I saw them walk back to the house again but I looked at the house for a long time and did not see anything.
					I told my friend but she did not believe me. Next week I went back to see the house and did not see anyone inside. I looked for a long time.
					i told my friend again and she said she will look with me. At night time we said we would look at the house together.
				</p>
				<p>At night time we knocked on the door but no one answered. I tried to open the door and it was unlocked. We both went inside and all the lights were on.
					We walked around quietly but we did not hear anything. We went into all the rooms and did not see anyone. There was no one in the house.
					We knocked on the house next to it and it is also unlocked. We walked and there was no one again. All the houses on the street are empty.
					No one lives in them.
				</p>
				<p>I do not know where the people go. The people in the house only leave the house when no one is looking. All the houses are empty.</p>

				<p> Update: I watched the news and a lot of police went over. I can not believe that the police read this and actually believed this story.
					If you are reading this, please know this is all a jokes. I would not break into peoples houses. There are no empty houses.
					I hope you like my stories.
