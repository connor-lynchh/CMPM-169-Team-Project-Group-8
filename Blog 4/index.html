        <h1>Deep in the Woods: A Mysterious Encounter</h1>
        <section class="minor-section">
            <h2>Prelude:</h2>
            <p>Before diving into the story, let me provide a bit more context to set the scene. This was my first time traveling outside of the U.S. alone. I was to spend a summer in Norway for a program in which I was participating. I was set up in a hostel on the outskirts of Oslo nestled against the vast forest that encased the city. The forest seemed a little foreboding when first arriving at the hostel but I didn't really give it much thought until later on in the program.</p>

            <h2>The Incident:</h2>
            <p>After a few weeks, I decided to start exploring this forest area to soak in the natural beauty of Norway. Each time I walked through these woods, I was entranced by the undisturbed quietness, which instilled a sense of calm within me. I would sometimes go for walks in the area and other times run through the forest. This was always done when there was light out until one night a run went longer than expected.</p>
            
            <p>I had taken a new path to run as I tried mixing up the route when I went into the forest. Fortunately, the trails were well-marked, so retracing my steps wouldn't be too difficult as long as I didn't stray too far from the path. I believe I left my room around 7:00 pm when I started this run and there was still a good amount of light out. The sun doesn't really set until 9:00 pm or 10:00 during the Summer in Norway. I take some normal routes that I do until I come to a fork in the road where I can now branch off to a new path. Naturally, I wanted to explore as many new areas as possible, so I took the new path. I pass by a beautiful little lake nested within the trees and climb on top of some rock formations that give a good overview of the forest and where I started from. I check my watch to see what time it is and it's getting close to 9:00 pm. The light starts to fade and I now think it might be a good idea to start heading back as I have quite a distance to cover. The sun continues to drop and I am not even halfway back to the hostel. In hindsight bringing my phone with me would have been a good idea but at the moment I have no way of communicating with anyone if something were to happen to me. I continue forward making sure to follow the markers on the path but they have become increasingly harder to see with the lower visibility.</p>
            
            <p>I pass by the lake I had discovered on this run now looking a little more ominous since I could no longer see the other side, only a dark watery expanse. As I passed by the lake I thought I heard a voice. A very faint one but persistent. I retraced my steps a little and there the voice was again a little louder but still far off. I can't say that I wasn't a little spooked but it didn't seem like this voice was getting closer to me in any way. For some reason my curiosity peaked and I wanted to investigate this noise. However, I couldn't exactly pinpoint the direction from which the voice was coming from. I attempted to follow some sort of direction and sure enough the voice grew a little louder. Now though I can hear a second voice. It is coming from the same location as the first voice and they seem to be saying something in unison. Moving down the path I was on, the voices seemed to grow louder and from what I could tell the origin of the voices probably lay only a few hundred feet to my left through a dense part of the forest. I could hear even more voices now and at this point the sun was almost entirely down. Being in the trees did not help visibility at all as it was much darker than if I were out in the open. It was drawing close to 9:30 or 9:45 pm. I still had quite a ways to go before I was back at the hostel. But I wanted to know what was going on. The voices almost seemed rhythmic as if they were chanting something. I couldn't make out what the words were as I assume they might have been speaking Norwegian or perhaps some other language. I wanted to know so bad what was going on that I tried crossing through the dense part of the forest to get eyes on these voices. This turned out to be a foolish mistake, as I quickly became disoriented, unable to see where my feet would land if I trekked through the dense part of the forest. I began to grow more fearful as I turned to leave the voices behind. My mind started to wander thinking of all the possible things that could be lurking out in the woods at night. I especially wondered if those chanting voices would come to hunt me down. As I thought about this more I grew even more afraid and by that point the adrenaline kicked in. The darkness had completely fallen across the forest and I could barely make out the steps in front of me. I didn't care though as everywhere I looked I thought I saw something staring right back at me. I must have fallen four or five times trying to get back to the hostel. My legs were cut up pretty bad from all the falls. At one point I thought I was going to be limping back but I didn't want to slow down so I pushed through sprained ankles and quickened my pace even more. I eventually managed to make it back to the hostel a little bloodied but safe. I went to bed that night thinking of what had just transpired. Did I hear voices chanting or was it something else? If there were people out there in the woods, what were they doing? It was so late that no one should have been out there unless they had set up a campsite but there was no possible place that I could have seen where the campsite would have been. That was the last time I ever went that late into the woods.</p>

            <h2>Epilogue:</h2>
            <p>I'm not sure if others have had similar experiences, but one thing is certain: I still wonder what happened that night. My curiosity drove a lot of my actions but my fear is what finally led me to a rational decision. Part of me still wishes that I had investigated further, but another part of me is glad I left before it was too late. Had I stayed a little longer, the darkness would have been so great that navigating anywhere in that forest would have been dangerous, as one wrong step could have left me tumbling down a cliffside. I would like to hear from the comments if you all think that going back into those woods to find the source of these voices would be worth it. It has been a little over 8 months since the incident occurred, so who knows if those people or whatever produced those noises will still be there. However, my curiosity about what was out there persists, despite the frightening experience.</p>
